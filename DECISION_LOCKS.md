# Pre-Pilot Absolute Lock
- No pilot, customer, design partner operational use, or external use is authorized before all of the following are `PASS`:
  1. `Product Loop Demonstrável`
  2. `Hardening Base`
  3. `Lab Real Simulation Pack`
  4. `ARIS Infernus Lab FULL`
  5. `ARIS Final Crisol FULL`
  6. `Productatization Gate`
- `Primeiro Piloto Controlado` remains blocked until every prerequisite above is materially passed.

# Governance Locks
- LLM-as-judge is not sovereign.
- Minos must remain deterministic.
- WARN does not unlock critical advancement.
- Historical material must be preserved instead of destructively overwritten when active direction changes.
- Silent roadmap mutation is forbidden.
- Retroactive pass claims are forbidden.
- Efficiency cannot remove governance gates, ledger, replay, permission, rollback, or evidence requirements.
- Property-based testing remains candidate-only until a later dependency gate explicitly authorizes installation and execution.
- `Ed25519`, `Merkle`, `OpenTelemetry`, and `DeepEval` remain future dependency-gated only.
- Retrieval runtime, MCP, and Obsidian runtime integrations remain future-gated and inactive.
- Context compression may not override decision quality, provenance, stale-context detection, or security.
