# Next Action

## Current Next Step
- `Lab Real Simulation Pack Controlled Apply Dry-Run Authorization Prerequisites Consolidation Gate`
- Status: `ready_for_next_subphase`
- Phase class: `planning_gate`
- Planning-only: `true`
- Review-only: `false`
- Execution authorization: `false`
- The governance-advancement-plan readiness review passed without executing anything real.
- The reviewed plan remains non-authorizing and must not be interpreted as runtime, dry-run, apply, Bedrock, or product authorization.
- Residual warnings remain carry-forward items, not silently resolved findings.
- Roadmap amendment required: `False`

## Before Starting the Next Phase
1. Read `ACTIVE_CONTEXT_STATE.json` first.
2. Run `python3 scripts/validate_active_context_state.py` and stop on any drift.
3. Preserve blocked-history semantics, residual warnings, and all non-authorization boundaries while consolidating prerequisites.
4. Only then proceed with `Lab Real Simulation Pack Controlled Apply Dry-Run Authorization Prerequisites Consolidation Gate`.
