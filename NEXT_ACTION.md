# Next Action

## Current Next Step
- `Lab Real Simulation Pack Controlled Apply Dry-Run Operator Authorization Packet Planning`
- Status: `ready_for_next_subphase`
- Phase class: `planning_gate`
- Planning-only: `true`
- Review-only: `false`
- Execution authorization: `false`
- Execution Authorization Planning Readiness Review passed as review-only and still did not authorize any execution.
- The next phase must plan the future operator authorization packet without authorizing real dry-run execution or real apply.
- Dangerous flags remain false and Bedrock remains non-executable.
- Roadmap amendment required: `True`

## Before Starting the Next Phase
1. Read `ACTIVE_CONTEXT_STATE.json` first.
2. Run `python3 scripts/validate_active_context_state.py` and stop on any drift.
3. Confirm the authorization-boundary review remains pass and all dangerous flags remain false.
4. Only then proceed with `Lab Real Simulation Pack Controlled Apply Dry-Run Operator Authorization Packet Planning`.
